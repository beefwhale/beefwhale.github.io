# Hi, I'm Yongqing!

I'm a Computer Engineering Freshman at NTU residing in Singapore. I love all things computers from hardware to software, and believe in the right to repair movement. Usually this is where people say *"Outside you'll catch me tinkering on.."* but no you'll never catch me outside. Legend says that the grass is green.
