# Hi, I'm Yongqing!

## If you're my future/current employer, read this:
I'm a Computer Engineering Freshman at NTU residing in Singapore interested in topics in software engineering, cybersecurity, design and recently I've been getting into philosophy! More specifically topics regarding Metaphysics, Conciousness and Epistomology. I enjoy doing various hobbies in my free time and dable in various parts of tech often! Currently open to work opportunities.

## If you're NOT my future/current employer, read this:
*Now that I've gotten all seriousness out of the way...skibididlydoo*

This blog exists so I can read back at the past work I did before my interview and remember what exactly I did.

<!-- Feel free to contact me on my socials about anything related to tech, design, hardware or even a simple chat. My inbox is always open. Toodles~! -->

## Going back in time..
