## Hi! I'm Yongqing, the author of this page. 

I am a Final Year student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic studying **Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics**, and I am slated to graduate this year in May 2024! Over the past 3 years, my education in Ngee Ann has grown my love for technology and realising the possibilities that it brings further fuels my passion in this field. Part of that passion has inspired me to start this very page, to document my entire journey as I go deeper into tech and master the skills that will allow me to give back to communities. 

Yes, as cliche as it sounds, I am not in this field for the big bucks but the possibilities of bringing change with my skills. I hope to make a difference with my work and am actively looking into opportunities where I can give back to the same communities that got me started on this journey. _(Currently looking into Open Source projects, please reach out to me if you have any suggestions or experience!)_

I hope that this site brings more insight into the thought processes behind my projects and works. If you have any questions, feel free to drop me an email or a message on LinkedIn. I would love to hear from you. Take care!
